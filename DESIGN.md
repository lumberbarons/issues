# issues — an agentic-first CLI for GitHub Issues

## Vision

An opinionated, single-user CLI that makes GitHub Issues work the way `bd` (beads)
works: instant answers to "what should I work on?", conventions enforced by the tool
instead of prose in CLAUDE.md, and token-lean output designed for agent context
windows. GitHub Issues stays the single source of truth — humans get the web UI,
PRs auto-close issues via `Fixes #n`, and nothing needs syncing.

The tool exists because the raw `gh` CLI has (since v2.94.0) all the *primitives* —
native sub-issues, blocked-by dependencies, JSON fields — but none of the *opinions*:
no ready-work detection, no convention enforcement, verbose output, and every agent
session re-derives the same jq pipelines from scratch.

### Non-goals

- Multi-user / team workflows. This is for one human and their agents.
- A local database or offline mode (v1). Every command hits the API; a cache is a
  later milestone only if latency actually hurts.
- General GitHub client. Anything the tool doesn't have an opinion about, use `gh`.

## Concepts borrowed from beads

| beads | this tool | GitHub mechanism |
|-------|-----------|------------------|
| `bd ready` — zero open blockers | `issues ready` | `blockedBy` (native dependencies), filtered + priority-sorted |
| `bd prime` — session-start context injection | `issues prime` | generated from live repo state + built-in conventions |
| hierarchical IDs (`bd-a3f8.1`) for epics | `issues epic` | native sub-issues (`parent` / `subIssues`) |
| `bd update --claim` — claim: assign + in-progress | `issues start` | assign `@me` + `in-progress` label |
| priorities 0–4 | P0–P4 labels | labels (issue *types* are org-only; labels work on personal repos) |
| token-lean, JSON-optional output | same | `--json` on every command, compact text default |
| `bd remember` — persistent insights | deferred (open question) | overlaps with Claude Code's own memory system |

Explicitly *not* borrowed: Dolt/git storage, hash IDs, sync — GitHub is the backend,
so the entire distributed-state problem beads solves disappears.

## Enshrined conventions

These are the conventions already proven in solar-controller's CLAUDE.md, moved from
prose into code. They are **guarantees on the tool's own write path** — anything
`create`/`set`/`epic` touches conforms — and **normalization rules on the read
path**. GitHub has many entry points (web UI, mobile, bots, drive-by bug reports),
so issues that don't follow the conventions are first-class citizens, not defects:
never hidden, never auto-"repaired". `prime` *teaches* the conventions.

- **Priority labels**, every issue gets exactly one: `P0` (critical) → `P4` (backlog).
  Default `P2`.
- **Type labels**, exactly one: `bug`, `enhancement`, `task`.
- **Area labels**, zero or more, flat names (`tests`, `web-ui`, ...). Created
  sparingly.
- **No title prefixes** — type/priority/area live in labels. Exception: `Epic: ` on
  parent issues, added by the tool.
- **Dependencies are native** (`--blocked-by`), never body text. The tool refuses to
  create cycles — GitHub itself only rejects self-blocks and direct two-issue
  cycles, not longer ones (see spike results).
- **Epics are sub-issue trees.** Epics are never worked directly; `ready` excludes
  them.
- **Discovered work** links back: `Discovered while working on #123` in the body,
  via `--discovered-from 123`.
- **Body template**: `### Where` / `### Problem`|`### Goal` / `### Fix`|`### Approach` /
  `### Done when` (checklist). Composed structurally by the create section flags
  (`--where`, `--problem`|`--goal`, `--fix`|`--approach`, repeatable `--done-when`) —
  headings, order, checklist formatting, and empty-section omission are write-path
  guarantees, not taught conventions. `--body-file` is the escape hatch for
  long-form bodies with code blocks. Wording pairs pick one flag; word choice is
  never policed against the type.
- **Workflow**: `ready` → `start` → branch (`feat/`|`fix/`|`chore/`) → PR with
  `Fixes #n`. Closing via PR is the norm; `close` is for wontfix/duplicate.
- **Claiming is guarded**: `start` refuses an issue that is already assigned or
  `in-progress` and exits with a distinct code, so an agent loop moves on to the
  next ready item instead of doubling up. GitHub has no conditional writes, so the
  guard is check-then-act with a re-read after claiming — a small race window
  remains (see open questions).
- **Untriaged, not broken**: an issue missing its priority or type label — typical
  for anything filed outside the tool — is *untriaged*, a normal state. `issues
  triage` lists them so a human or agent can label each via `set`; nothing is ever
  stamped with defaults automatically, since auto-labeling someone else's report
  destroys information.
- **Contradictions** (two priority labels, an in-progress epic, a dependency cycle)
  are the only per-issue warnings `prime` emits; normalization still picks a
  deterministic answer in the meantime. Cycles matter most: their members all have
  open blockers, so they'd otherwise drop out of `ready` without a trace.

### Read-path normalization

Deterministic rules, implemented pure in `internal/model` and stated in the `prime`
primer so agents know what they're looking at:

- Missing priority → renders as `P?`, sorts after P4. Multiple priority labels →
  highest wins, plus a warning.
- Missing type → shown without one. Multiple → first of bug|enhancement|task wins,
  plus a warning.
- Epic-ness = *has sub-issues*; the `Epic: ` title prefix is cosmetic. `ready`
  excludes any issue with sub-issues.
- Bodies render as-is. The template is scaffolding for `create`, never retrofitted
  onto issues written by others.
- Untriaged issues do appear in `ready` (invisible work is the failure mode), sorted
  after explicitly-prioritized work. `start` on an untriaged issue requires
  `--priority` — claiming forces triage.

```

Global flags: `--json` (structured output, stable schema), `--repo owner/name`
(default: detect from git remote via go-gh).

### `issues pr`

The last step of the claim lifecycle, and the only one the tool used not to
cover: `ready → start → branch → PR` was enforced up to the branch, then handed
off to a freeform `gh pr create`. That gap costs twice — description format
drifts, and a forgotten `Fixes #n` leaves the issue claimed-but-orphaned after
the merge, needing a manual close. A repository PR template doesn't close it:
agents pass `--body` directly, which bypasses templates entirely.

`pr` is composition and guards, not a reimplementation of `gh pr`. Reviews,
merges, checks and PR listing stay where they are.

- **Which issue.** The claim is the primary signal — it's tracker state, not a
  naming guess: exactly one open non-epic issue assigned to you is the answer.
  A number in the branch name (`feat/30-pr-command`) breaks ties when several
  are claimed and stands in when none is, but only as a whole `-`/`/`-delimited
  segment, so `fix/http500-retries` doesn't link `#500`. Anything still
  ambiguous is a usage error naming the candidates; `--for <n>` settles it. The
  cost of guessing wrong is closing the wrong issue on merge, so guessing is
  not on the menu.
- **Exactly one `Fixes #n`.** The composed body always writes one, plus
  `Part of #<epic>` when the issue is a sub-issue. A `--body-file` gets
  whichever of those links it doesn't already make, so the escape hatch can't
  quietly lose one — and never a second copy. A body already carrying a
  closing keyword (`fixes`/`closes`/`resolves`, any case — GitHub acts on all
  of them) is refused if it names a different issue, or several.
- **Body template.** `### What / ### Why / ### Testing`, mirroring the issue
  template and lives beside it in `internal/conventions`. What and Why default
  to the issue's own `Fix`/`Approach` and `Problem`/`Goal` sections — the issue
  already says this — so in the common case only `--testing` is worth typing.
  Empty sections are omitted, never left as bare headers.
- **Title convention.** A squash merge makes the PR title the commit subject,
  and the release changelog is grouped by conventional-commit prefix, so the
  default title is `<prefix>: <issue title>` with the prefix derived from the
  type label: `bug` → `fix`, `enhancement` → `feat`, `task` → `chore`. Issue
  titles carry no prefix by convention (the label holds that), which is exactly
  why the type is the right thing to derive it from. An untyped issue gets no
  prefix — there is nothing to derive one from, and an invented one files the
  work under the wrong heading. `--title` is passed through untouched, prefixed
  or not, and a title that already carries one is never given a second.
- **Guards.** Draft by default (`--ready` opens for review). Refuses an
  unpushed branch (GitHub can only open a PR for a ref it can see), the default
  branch itself, a branch that already has an open PR (named, rather than
  relayed as the API's 422), and an epic as the target. Warns — rather than
  refuses — on a branch outside `feat/|fix/|chore/|docs/` and on an issue
  claimed by someone else: the work is already committed by then, so refusing
  would only strand it.

Local branch state comes from `internal/git`, injected into the App as a
function the way `--edit`'s editor is, so the command stays testable without a
checkout. Two API calls beyond the issue read: one query for the default branch
and any existing PR on the head, one REST create.

### `issues prime`

The session-start ritual, modeled on `bd prime`: one command whose output an agent
injects at the top of a session (via CLAUDE.md instruction or hook) instead of
maintaining hand-written workflow prose. Three parts:

1. **Static primer** — the conventions and workflow above, compressed to a few
   hundred tokens, including the tool's own command cheatsheet.
2. **Live state** — ready work (top N by priority), in-progress issues and their
   assignee, epics with progress (`#137 Voltgo 2/6`), and open-blocker counts.
3. **Warnings** — contradictions only (`⚠ #42 has two priority labels`,
   `⚠ dependency cycle #3 → #4 → #5 → #3: none will be ready`). Absences
   are not warnings: untriaged work rolls up to a single line (`7 untriaged →
   issues triage`), so a public repo full of drive-by reports doesn't drown the
   primer. Section omitted entirely when the repo is clean.

Sketch:

```
# issues primer — lumberbarons/solar-controller
Workflow: issues ready → issues start <n> → branch (feat/|fix/|chore/) → PR "Fixes #n".
File discovered work with --discovered-from. Never work an epic directly.

## Ready (3 of 14 open)
#120 P2 enhancement  Voltgo BLE battery controller: scaffold, client, collector
#117 P1 bug (tests)  Tautological assertions on state the code cannot modify
#119 P2 enhancement  Proper auth: login flow with sessions, API keys

## In progress (1)
#124 P2 bug (tests)  /api/info verified by substring matching  @lumberbarons

## Epics
#137 Voltgo BLE battery controller support  0/6
```

Everything after the header is one line per issue: `#n priority type (areas) title`.
No URLs, no timestamps, no prose. Target: whole primer under ~600 tokens for a
typical repo.

## Output principles

- Default output is compact fixed-column text, one line per issue, no ANSI when not
  a TTY, no URLs (agents know `#n` + repo), stable sort order. Non-ready state is
  annotated inline (`[blocked by #120]`, `[epic 2/6]`, `[in progress @user]`), and
  `list` sorts ready work first, then claimed, blocked, epics — one call answers
  both "what's actionable" and "what's stuck on what" (solar-controller dogfood
  feedback, 2026-07-11).
- `--json` everywhere, with a flat schema (deps as number arrays, not
  `{nodes:[...]}` wrappers — hide GraphQL shapes from consumers). List-shaped
  output is NDJSON, one compact object per line: a truncated JSON array is
  unparseable garbage, a truncated NDJSON stream is just shorter (same feedback).
  The primer states both formats so agents reach for the cheap one.
- Errors are one line, actionable, exit codes meaningful (`ready` with no results
  exits 0 with `no ready work`; `start` on a claimed issue exits 3 with
  `already claimed`; auth failure exits 4; etc.).

## Architecture

- **Language/runtime**: Go (single static binary, `go install`-able).
- **CLI framework**: `github.com/urfave/cli/v3` (v3.10.1 at time of writing).
- **GitHub access**: `github.com/cli/go-gh/v2` (v2.13.0) — reuses `gh`'s stored
  credentials and host config, provides REST + GraphQL clients and repo detection
  from the git remote. No own auth flow at all; `gh auth login` is a prerequisite.
- **API strategy**: one GraphQL query per command where possible. `ready`/`prime`
  fetch all open issues with `blockedBy`, `parent`, `subIssues`, labels, assignees
  in a single paginated query and filter client-side — avoids N+1 and stays trivially
  inside rate limits for single-user scale. Where the API offers server-side rollups
  (`subIssuesSummary`, `issueDependenciesSummary`), prefer them over fetching nested
  nodes just to count.
- **Layout**:
  - `cmd/issues/` — main, urfave/cli command wiring
  - `internal/gh/` — thin API layer (interface, so commands are testable against a fake)
  - `internal/model/` — Issue/Epic domain types, ready/normalization/cycle logic
    (pure, unit-tested)
  - `internal/render/` — text + JSON renderers (golden-file tests)
  - `internal/conventions/` — labels, body and PR templates, primer text (the opinions
    live here)
  - `internal/git/` — local branch state for `pr` (current branch, has-upstream)
- **Testing**: unit tests against a fake API layer; golden files for renderer output.
  An integration smoke test against a real scratch repo (behind a build tag, run
  manually — it needs a token and mutates state, so it stays out of CI) is deferred
  for now.

## Build & distribution

- **CI** (GitHub Actions, actions pinned by SHA at their latest versions): one
  workflow triggered on PRs and pushes to `main`, running `golangci-lint` and the
  full test suite (`go test -race -coverprofile ./...`), plus `shellcheck` on
  `install.sh` — the one thing strangers pipe into bash gets linted like everything
  else. Go version comes from `go.mod`.
- **Coverage gate**: 90% minimum, blocking. Go's toolchain measures *statement*
  coverage only (line-equivalent in practice; there is no native branch coverage —
  see gobco note in open questions), enforced with `go-test-coverage` in CI.
  `cmd/` wiring is excluded so the bar bites on the logic packages
  (`internal/model`, `internal/render`, `internal/conventions`, `internal/gh`).
- **Dependabot** keeps the SHA-pinned actions and Go modules fresh (`github-actions`
  and `gomod` ecosystems), configured with a cooldown so new releases settle before
  we pick them up.
- **Releases are tag-driven**: pushing a `vX.Y.Z` tag runs goreleaser, which builds
  static binaries for linux and macOS (amd64 + arm64, CGO off), stamps the version
  into `issues --version` via ldflags, and publishes the archives plus a checksums
  file as a GitHub Release. Release notes come from goreleaser's changelog grouping
  over commit prefixes (`feat:`/`fix:`/`docs:`/...), which we already write.
- **install.sh** at the repo root, usable as
  `curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lumberbarons/issues/main/install.sh | bash`:
  detects OS/arch via `uname`, resolves the latest release through the GitHub API,
  downloads the matching archive, verifies it against the checksums file, and
  installs to `$HOME/.local/bin` (`INSTALL_DIR` overrides; never sudo), printing a
  PATH hint when needed. `go install .../cmd/issues@latest` remains the
  toolchain-native alternative.

## Spike results (2026-07-10)

The design's riskiest assumptions, tested against the live GitHub API before writing
any product code.

- **GraphQL surface exists — pass.** The `Issue` type exposes `blockedBy`, `blocking`,
  `parent`, `subIssues`, and — a bonus the design didn't assume — server-side rollups
  `issueDependenciesSummary` and `subIssuesSummary`, which `epic status` and blocked
  counts should prefer over client-side counting. The mutations `addBlockedBy` /
  `removeBlockedBy` / `addSubIssue` / `removeSubIssue` / `reprioritizeSubIssue` all
  exist, so `block`, `unblock`, and `epic create` have first-class API support. No
  preview/feature headers required for any of it.
- **Single "fetch everything" query — pass.** One request for all open issues with
  labels, assignees, `parent`, `subIssues`, and `blockedBy` against solar-controller
  (19 open issues) completes in ~300 ms. `blockedBy` nodes carry `state`, so `ready`
  treats closed blockers as non-blocking with no extra queries. Rate limits and
  latency are non-issues at single-user scale; the no-cache-in-v1 call stands.
  Caveat confirmed: nested connections don't paginate with the outer issues cursor —
  v1 caps them (`first: 50` sub-issues, `first: 20` blockers) and must warn when
  `totalCount` exceeds the cap rather than silently truncate.
- **go-gh smoke test — pass.** A throwaway `main.go` (~80 lines) using
  `repository.Current()` and `api.DefaultGraphQLClient()` detected the repo from the
  git remote, reused `gh`'s keyring credentials with no auth code of our own, ran the
  query above, and computed 13 ready of 19 open with the client-side filter. This is
  effectively M0's skeleton.
- **`prime` token budget — pass.** A full mock primer
  ([docs/primer-mock.md](docs/primer-mock.md)) for a busy repo — static conventions
  and command cheatsheet plus live Ready / In progress / Blocked / Epics sections —
  measures ~640 tokens (tiktoken `o200k_base`; Claude's tokenizer typically runs
  slightly higher). The split is roughly half static, half live, so the ~600 target
  holds as long as live sections cap at top-N per section.
- **Cycle rejection — partial; client-side check confirmed necessary.** Tested live
  with throwaway issues (deleted afterwards). The API rejects self-blocks (`Target
  issue cannot be the same as the source issue`) and direct two-issue cycles (`this
  dependency would create a cycle where the target is already blocked by the
  source`) as typed GraphQL `VALIDATION` errors — but **accepted a three-issue
  cycle** (A←B, B←C, then C←A) without complaint: the edges are stored, returned by
  `blockedBy`, and counted by `issueDependenciesSummary` as if nothing were wrong.
  Two consequences. First, `block` and `create --blocked-by` must run a transitive
  cycle check client-side before mutating — the fetch-everything query already has
  the whole graph. Second, since cycles can be created outside the tool (web UI,
  raw API), the read path must detect them too: every member of a cycle has an open
  blocker, so a cycle silently excludes all its members from `ready` forever.
  `prime` and `ready` warn when they see one.

## Milestones

- **M0 — scaffold**: module, urfave/cli v3 skeleton, go-gh auth + repo detection,
  `issues list` (proves the GraphQL query and renderer end-to-end). The query
  includes `parent`/`subIssues`/`blockedBy` from day one — field names, header
  requirements, nested-cap behavior, and cycle semantics are all verified (see
  spike results), so this milestone has no API unknowns left. CI (lint + full
  tests) arrives with the scaffold.
- **M1 — read**: `ready`, `show`, `epic status`, `prime` v1. *This is the payoff
  milestone — adopt in solar-controller immediately.* The first tagged release
  (goreleaser + install.sh) ships here, since adoption needs an installable binary.
- **M2 — write**: `create` (template + label enforcement), `set` (retriage —
  priority changes are the most common tracker operation, and doing them through
  the tool is what keeps the one-label invariants true), `triage`, `block`/`unblock`
  with cycle detection, `start`, `close`, `epic create`.
- **M3 — bootstrap**: `init` (create label set in a fresh repo, emit the CLAUDE.md
  snippet that says little more than "run `issues prime`"). Replace solar-controller's
  hand-written conventions section with it.
- **M4 — polish**: `--json` everywhere, pagination hardening, maybe a read cache,
  maybe `remember`. Distribution is `go install` only — no `gh` extension; agents
  invoke the bare `issues` binary and that's the whole interface.

## Open questions

- **Name — resolved.** Binary and repo are `issues`. `is` was considered — no shell
  builtin, POSIX utility, or popular tool conflicts with it — but rejected as
  ungreppable and ambiguous in prose and transcripts (`is block 42 --on 7`). Anyone
  who wants the terse form can `alias is=issues` locally; agents use the real name.
- **`remember`.** beads couples memory to the tracker; Claude Code has its own
  memory system. Skip, or implement as comments on a pinned "agent notes" issue?
  Deferred to M4 — need real usage first.
- **in-progress signal.** Label (visible, filterable) vs assignee-only (no label
  churn). v1: both — assign is the claim, label is the visibility.
- **Multi-repo prime.** Someday `issues prime --all-repos` for a workspace overview?
  Out of scope for v1.
- **Branch coverage.** The Go toolchain only does statement coverage; `gobco` adds
  branch/condition coverage via source instrumentation but is niche and awkward in
  CI. Revisit if statement coverage starts hiding untested branches in practice.
- **Same-user claim races.** Every agent authenticates as `@me`, so two parallel
  sessions that race `start` inside the guard window are indistinguishable by
  assignee or label — both think they won. If this happens in practice, tie-break
  with a claim comment carrying a session nonce (earliest comment wins, loser backs
  off). Deferred until actually observed.
