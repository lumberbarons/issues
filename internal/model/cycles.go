// edges. GitHub only rejects self-blocks and direct two-issue cycles, so
// longer cycles can exist (created via web UI or raw API) and must be
// detected client-side: every member of a cycle has an open blocker, so a
// cycle silently excludes all its members from ready forever.
//
// allOpen must be every open issue in the repository. Edges to issues not in
// the set are dropped as non-blocking, so passing a filtered subset yields
// false negatives — a cycle whose members were filtered out goes undetected.
//
// Each cycle is returned once as a slice of issue numbers in edge order
// (a blocked-by b blocked-by c ... blocked-by a), starting from its
